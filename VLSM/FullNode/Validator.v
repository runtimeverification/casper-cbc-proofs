  (** * Full-node validator VLSM instance

  Here we define a VLSM for a full-node validator identifying itself as
  <<v>> when sending messages.

  The validator and incorporates messages (sent by other validators), and
  creates and sends new messages proposing consensus values estimated based
  on its current state, signing them with its name and current state.

  Unlike the client, no equivocation check is done within the validator upon
  receiving a new message.
