# TL;DR

December was a short month. Nevertheless, we've been making progress in the following main directions:

* Liveness for simple example protocol
* An inductive characterization for received/sent messages
* Making documentation more accessible through Proof Movies
* Framework for equivocation based on observations
* Common futures for List Validators protocol

Part of the work mentioned above has already been been succesfully merged into the main branch in the repository. Quantitatively, they represent ~2400 addeed lines and ~1400 removed lines, ~45 new definitions, 2 new classes, and 40 new lemmas being stated and proven.

# Work on Liveness

1. Descovered missing assumption in the spec requiring all participants to receive before advancing.

1. Proved that clocks eventually advance

# Sent/Received/Observed messages

1. Added alternative (direct, inductive) characterizations for `has_been_sent` and `has_been_received` capabilities

1. Introduced `has_been_observed` as a new unifying capability 


# Documentation of the formalization

1.Proof movies are fully integrated with our current continuous integration process. 

1. We are working with the maintainers of the Proof Movies tool to incorporate
other desirable facilities such as interlinking.

# Refactoring work on the definition of equivocation based on observations

1. The existing definitions assumes that the set of observations for a given 
state and validator is computable. This has been changed to bear closer
resemblance to the `has_been_sent`/`has_been_received`/`has_been_observed` 
predicates, i.e., a decidable relation between states and events.

1. The `subject_of_observation` was made partial to allow for events with no
subject (e.g., observations on an initial state). This is in line with the 
`sender` function for messages also being partial.

1. Existing definitions and results based on the previous definitions were 
updated to work with the new ones.

# Work on common futures for the List Validators protocol

1. Progress on List Validators proofs

1. Intergating existing results into the main repository
