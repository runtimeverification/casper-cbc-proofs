# TL;DR

For the past month we've been making progress in the following four main directions:

* Equivocators composition and the relation between state-based equivocation and message-based equivocation
* Refactorings to improve code maintainability
* Common futures for List Validators protocol
* Liveness for the full-node protocol

The work concerning the first two items above has been succesfully merged into the main branch in the repository. Quantitatively, they represent ~5500 addeed lines and ~2000 removed lines, and 17 new lemmas being stated and proven. Most important results among these are the `equivocators_protocol_trace_project` and `equivocators_protocol_trace_project_rev` relating state-base equivocation in the composition of equivocators with message-based equivocation in the free composition.

# Work on equivocators composition

1. Part of the work on equivocators composition done in November was redefining the composition of equivocators to only consist of equivocating nodes, delegating the task of specifying non-equivocating participants to the composition constraint. These can be found in the `VLSM.Equivocators.Composition.Common.v` module.

1. To model how to extract a state for the regular composition of nodes from a state belonging to the composition of equivocators we introduced the notion of `equivocators_choice` which allows selecting a single state for each equivocator. Lemma `equivocators_protocol_state_project` shows that the projection of a protocol state for the composition of equivocators with a no-message-equivocation constraint along any `equivocators_choice` is protocol for the free composition of the corresponding nodes.

1. Going further, we needed to project transitions using `equivocators_choice`s and to track how such a choice changes for the duration of a trace due to the equivocating transitions. The main result for this part is `equivocators_protocol_trace_project` which shows that by projecting a protocol trace for the composition of equivocators with a no-message-equivocation constraint along any `equivocators_choice` we get a trace which is protocol for the free composition of the corresponding nodes.

1. To prove the converse result, we employed the strategy of simulating a protocol trace for the free composition within a composition of equivocators. An important step of this plan was fully replaying a trace at the end of an existing trace. Lemma `replay_trace_from_state_correspondence` is instrumental by relating the projections of the last state of a trace obtained through such a replay with the projections of the last states of the two involved traces. Lemma `replay_trace_from_protocol_equivocating` shows that the the replayed trace is protocol whenever the original traces were.

1. Finally we prove by structural induction that any `vlsm_run` for the free composition can be simulated by a `vlsm_run` for the composition of equivocators with a no-message-equivocation constraint (Lemma `equivocators_protocol_vlsm_run_project`) and we specialize that to protocol traces (Lemma `equivocators_protocol_trace_project_rev`)

# Work on common futures for the List Validators protocol

1. For better bookkeeping, we composed a checklist outlining the rough structure of the Common Futures proof and our current progress, it's available in the project dashboard. The Common Future Proof has three main steps: the send phase, the receive phase and proving properties regarding equivocators in the resulting state. 

1. In November we finished some admitted results regarding the send phase being protocol and refactored some existing work to integrate the `action` model that we used for the receive phase.

1. We completed the proof of the receive phase being protocol and the resulting composite state having the expected projections, modulo some general utility results which are currently admitted. 

1. Working on the first two phases has generated new definitions and results of a general nature: the `preserves/ensures` action model in `Actions.v`, the `relevant_components` lemmas regarding the free composition and multiple utility results in `ListExtras.v`, `ListSetExtras.v`. 

1. We've started work for phase three, approaching the main results. This requires several results regarding the way observable equivocation evidence changes during phases one and two, which further implies refactoring some older results to accomodate them to the new observation type.
