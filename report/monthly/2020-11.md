# TL;DR

For the past month we've been making progress in the following five main directions:

* Equivocators composition and the relation between state-based equivocation and message-based equivocation
* Common futures for List Validators protocol
* Liveness for the full-node protocol
* Documentation of the formalization
* Refactorings to improve code readability and maintainability

The work concerning the first and the last of the items above has been succesfully merged into the main branch in the repository. Quantitatively, they represent ~5500 addeed lines and ~2000 removed lines, and 17 new lemmas being stated and proven. Most important results among these are the `equivocators_protocol_trace_project` and `equivocators_protocol_trace_project_rev` relating state-base equivocation in the composition of equivocators with message-based equivocation in the free composition.

# Work on equivocators composition

1. Redefined the composition of equivocators to only consist of equivocating nodes, delegating the task of specifying non-equivocating participants to the composition constraint. These can be found in the `VLSM.Equivocators.Composition.Common.v` module.

1. To model how to extract a state for the regular composition of nodes from a state belonging to the composition of equivocators we introduced the notion of `equivocators_choice` which allows selecting a single state for each equivocator. Lemma `equivocators_protocol_state_project` shows that the projection of a protocol state for the composition of equivocators with a no-message-equivocation constraint along any `equivocators_choice` is protocol for the free composition of the corresponding nodes.

1. We modeled projecting transitions using `equivocators_choice`s and tracking how such a choice changes for the duration of a trace due to the equivocating transitions. The main result for this part is `equivocators_protocol_trace_project` which shows that by projecting a protocol trace for the composition of equivocators with a no-message-equivocation constraint along any `equivocators_choice` we get a trace which is protocol for the free composition of the corresponding nodes.

1. To prove the converse result, we employed the strategy of simulating a protocol trace for the free composition within a composition of equivocators. An important step of this plan was fully replaying a trace at the end of an existing trace. Lemma `replay_trace_from_state_correspondence` is instrumental for this phase by relating the projections of the last state of a trace obtained through such a replay with the projections of the last states of the two involved traces. Lemma `replay_trace_from_protocol_equivocating` shows that the replayed trace is protocol whenever the original traces were.

1. Finally we prove by structural induction that any `vlsm_run` for the free composition can be simulated by a `vlsm_run` for the composition of equivocators with a no-message-equivocation constraint (Lemma `equivocators_protocol_vlsm_run_project`) and we specialize that to protocol traces (Lemma `equivocators_protocol_trace_project_rev`)

# Work on common futures for the List Validators protocol

1. For better bookkeeping, we composed a checklist outlining the rough structure of the Common Futures proof and our current progress, it's available in the project dashboard. The Common Future Proof has three main steps: the send phase, the receive phase and proving properties regarding equivocators in the resulting state. 

1. In November we finished some admitted results regarding the send phase being protocol and refactored some existing work to integrate the `action` model that we used for the receive phase.

1. We completed the proof of the receive phase being protocol and the resulting composite state having the expected projections, modulo some general utility results which are currently admitted. 

1. Working on the first two phases has generated new definitions and results of a general nature: the `preserves/ensures` action model in `Actions.v`, the `relevant_components` lemmas regarding the free composition and multiple utility results in `ListExtras.v`, `ListSetExtras.v`. 

1. We've started work for phase three, approaching the main results. This requires several results regarding the way observable equivocation evidence changes during phases one and two, which further implies refactoring some older results to accomodate them to the new observation type. 

# Work on Liveness

1. We defined the liveness property, clocks, plans, and the "no synchronization faults no equivocation" composition constraint, following 3.4, 8.1, and 8.2.0.1 in the VLSM draft.

1. We defined the validators and composite VLSM of the simple example protocol for liveness, following 8.2.0.2 and 8.2.0.3, and also proving necessary auxiliary results such as `has_been_sent_capability`. This is similar to the existing CBC.FullNode definitions, but states and messages all have an added timestamps.

1. We started work on proving liveness, by defining a candidate variant for
   proving that validators eventually tick. Using the variant would require
a bound on how far ahead the clocks of other components could be, if a target
validator hasn't reached a time where the plan calls for it to send a message.
However, it turns out that nothing prevented a validator from advancing its
clock if an expected message hasn't even been sent yet (the composition constraint
only enforces that already-sent messages are received before advancing the clock).
This can probably be fixed by simply requiring that all plan-expected messages
have been received, in the right clause of the validator's validity condition.

# Refactorings to improve code maintainability

1. We have worked on improving the definitions related to strict orderings, which are used throughout the VLSM formalization. Specifically, we have finished a refactored hierarchy of type classes for strict orderings, and are in the process of updating the VLSM definitions. This is expected to lead to many simplified proofs.

1. Reduced the usage of boolean functions by replacing them with decidable properties to improve the ability to use automation when working with them.

1. Added mode annotations for typeclasses to make the resolution algorithm more deterministic and not diverging.

# Documentation of the formalization

1. We have investigated documenting the VLSM formalization as "proof movies", i.e., as a website that can interactively replay a proof script. This can help people interested in the formalization to better understand the definitions, properties, and formal proofs, and complements other HTML documentation. We have recently proposed automated generation of proof movies each time a new commit is merged in the GitHub VLSM repository.
