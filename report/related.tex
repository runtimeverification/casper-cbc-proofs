In terms of related work, of significance is the recent formalization of Casper CBC in Isabelle \cite{Nakamura}.
Our approach resembles that of Nakamura et al. from a high-level point of view, however, we try to keep the protocol as abstract as possible and formalize the results as closely as possible to their statement in the Casper CBC white papers.
Further, while \cite{Nakamura} only tackles the full node version of Casper TFG and formulate and prove for it a slightly different version of safety, we prove safety, non-triviality, and strong non-triviality for both the full node and light node abstrplans of Casper CBC.
On a more technical note, their definition of full node messages uses lists instead of sets of messages for justification, ``because sets can not be used for recursive definition'' \cite{Nakamura-github}; to capture the intended idea of sets we use a more involved definition for states and ensure that protocol states are always sorted.

Our future directions for CBC Casper in Coq include further developing our abstrplan hierarchy to include strong non-triviality. We are also interested to explore whether other consensus protocols can fit at various levels of this hierarchy. Additionally, we intend to develop and prove further properties about CBC Casper, including liveness.
